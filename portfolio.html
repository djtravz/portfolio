            <h1>Intros:</h1>
            Every morning at Wilson High School, the Wilson Media Productions club runs the Morning Announcements. My freshman year, the interns started to make intros to the announcements that were based on TV show intros. Ever since then, there has been a constant flow of intros coming from different people from around the club, here are mine.

                This was the first intro I made and my first major foray into the media club as a whole. One of the interns at the time recorded all the clips with the teachers. They even used my empty picture frame because the club didn't even have one (I forgot to take it home for a few months)

                We needed an intro to start off the school year, so we came in a few weeks before school started and decided to do an intro based on Law and Order. We got the script for the intro ready and recorded that day, then went out and recorded a lot of random footage throughout the school. We then split into groups to edit the final thing and I worked alone. We submitted all the final renders and voted on which one we liked the best (it wasn't mine). The thing I was most proud of at the time was the transitions with the title graphic because it very closely matches the original.

                This was made right before the primary elections that year on a whim the day before because we found the original clip very funny. Once we showed it, we were informed that it is actually very harmful to the giraffes because their necks sometimes break, so it was quite insensitive to show as a joke.

                I worked on this one for the launch of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. I got all the people in the club to submit videos of them doing something funny and I made a template to use. It's based off the character reveal trailers specifically for Smash 4 because it looks a lot more interesting than the new game. Most other memes using this format will either have the wrong font, incorrectly positioned, or wrong layering which bothers me after seeing myself do it perfectly.

                <h2>Wii Startup</h2>
                This intro is based off of the startup on the Wii. It uses old intros that I could compile as the fillers for the “channels” of the wii. There are so many layers inside of this menu that you really don't notice when using it. The cursor is all manually keyframed and every channel it hovers over gets highlighted with the same animation. I also replaced all the instances of “Wii” with “WMP” which looks really really good. Even the time is updated to the time that we normally started announcements. My favorite part is definitely the 3 seconds at the beginning because it took me well over an hour to get everything perfect.

                <h2>Cowboy Bebop</h2>
                This is the biggest intro I had worked on to this point. I started it and got a lot of the basics done on a 7 day adobe trial because the school canceled my subscription over the summer. I had a friend help me do the animations which took them about a month. I had to crop the song because it would be past our max length for intros if I didn't. I have gotten so used to it that the original sounds wrong. The thing that I like the least about it is the text flying in the background. It really should have just been random Japanese characters because it's too easy to read (or maybe even translating what it originally says), while the ending section is definitely my favorite. The ending point was profile pictures for all of the officers of the Media club at the time, so I got the outlines and made them like the original show. I also enjoy the amount of effort I put into the first 3 seconds. Each of those 4 sections is only like 5 frames, but it looks really good, especially the last two. Something else interesting is that I had to make the specks on the logo in the end just in Microsoft Paint because it had simple editing which was exactly what I needed.

I got the planet spinning from a pixel art planet generator app which was pretty fun to work with. I think it turned out really well for how little effort actually put into it.

                <h2>Wilson5</h2>
                This tops Bebop as the biggest intro at the time. We decided in September that we needed to start working on an intro for Halloween so we were going through spooky ideas and watched all of the Local58 videos on YouTube. I was instantly motivated and a friend designed the basis for what I would base the logo off of. I made it a lot better in Photoshop and am very happy with how it turned out. I originally started by just making a simple intro. I then started working on the actual scary section and it turned out super badly at first because I was trying to make my own thing. After a lot of revisions we realized that it was just slowly turning into a direct copy of Weather Service, but that's alright. I recorded the footage needed and got it done relatively quickly. The plan was to run the normal looking retro intro for the whole month then transform it into the scary one directly on October 31st, but the principal vetoed it the week before, which was disappointing, but valid since we don't want to cause panic. We ended up just sending it out in an email. A few months later there was a FilmFest going on in the area, so I made some minor fixes to it and extended it to the 4:30 mark that was required. When I went to submit it, there were some super weird issues that caused me not to be able to, but I don't really mind that much. (this is not the version that I have uploaded here)

                I saw the death screen for Metal Gear Solid and instantly thought of how cool it would look as an intro so I started working on it. The entire thing is made pretty badly with every line being its own video just slotted into place, but it turned out well enough, in my opinion. We even turned it into the design for the next year's club shirt.

                <h2>Frozen</h2>
                This was our winter intro for this year. I used Cinema4D, a 3D rendering program, to create it, which I had no experience with going into. I managed to make something pretty alright, but it definitely could be better in terms of the cover up of the original ice and the tracking of the new ice onto the background. Also the text is super wide so it is not too much like the original, but its still alright. There are 30 seconds of stillness at the end because we used the first last bit of the music to have a really nice transition into the announcements. It was hard to do but created a great audio/visual effect.

                This was another thing that I saw and instantly thought of it being an intro. I worked on it over winter break and got a pretty good result over just that week. I also made this in Cinema4D and the text can't have any of the effects that I needed for the project without purchasing the full version. I needed a much bigger stroke around the text, but it just wasn't possible. It looks alright as it is but still needed more lighting and a better globe model.

                We once again needed an intro for the Halloween spooky season and decided on this one. Our advisor recorded the voice over and I got all the footage. The text breaking animation was pretty fun to do, but the stars were annoying. I cut out all the footage which actually turned out pretty well against the black background. I wanted to make the door thicker, but After Effects doesn't support extruding video layers, so I just had to stack 50 doors on top of each other which created a weird effect but it looks alright. The motion of some things look weird, but it's as close to the original as I could get. Overall, I'm pretty happy with it.

                <h2>Winter 2020</h2>
                This intro was just done on a whim over a few days because I didn't really have an idea or anything to use for a winter intro. The idea first started with the snow covering the screen, but that would have been too hard to implement, so I just settled for making it like drawing on a frosted window (like you would do on a school bus). The snow fall was done using a simple effect in After Effects and I think it turned out pretty well. The actual announcements that this intro'ed had a nice overlay of snow going throughout as well as the Now Playing graphics beforehand. I originally had the graphics for the lower third transition using the snow becoming super dense across the entire screen, but it turned out to destroy the bitrate of the stream, so I switched to it just covering a small section.

                This intro is the one that I am the most proud of overall. I spent the summer planning to use it as the first intro, but it really didn't work out as that at all. I just used that summer as making the template where I would replace the footage later. It took until around November for me to start emailing teachers during my downtime of not working on other projects. When I did have a project that I needed to work on, I would get caught working on this one because it was just so much fun. I sent out about 100 emails to or from teachers to plan out times to come during their classes to record. Only one of them was staged and the rest had actual students in the classrooms. The footage was also very useful to use in other projects because it was a bulk selection of strong B-Roll of students in classes. I managed to get the last clips I needed the day before I planned to start running the intro and finished it over that weekend.

                After Wilson's Minds I had no other real ideas for intros, so I used this month to come up with more ideas. This month consisted of using two old intros per week and using the actual announcements set with the announcers (still virtually recording) placed in monitors sitting on the set. I even re-edited the wii startup to have more recent intros that people will be more likely to recognize. It turned out very well for the effort I put in.

I even added in the sound of me spamming the button like "oh no oh no, not here not here" which I think is funny. It's definitely people's least favorite intro of the year, but hey, the competition is high.

I recorded the google meet window with my camera on which I think has a nice touch. I even stealthily zoomed in on each of the windows in post so they would be a bit easier to read.

                <h2>Cleaning Devices</h2>
                This one was my idea because I had started to work on Chromebooks that were not very clean, so I thought it would be a good idea to give information on how to properly clean them (and also clarify that yes, it is good to clean electronics because some people think it will harm the device). This is probably my least favorite Tech Tip because the camera looks quite bad and there is no strong lighting.

                Using the feedback from the last time, this one has better lighting… but with the better lighting comes shadows. I had to do a minor chroma key on just the shadows to make them darker so they wouldn't stick out as much. I think the multiple angles also turned out really well.

                Skyward is the grading and student management application that our school used. A lot of students don't have the simple toggles enabled which make it so much easier to use, or they don't know how to get their test results.

We got no new members and realized that it was probably just because of the COVID year. The video turned out well, though, and was fun to record because I had to memorize my path and script. There's some minor things that could be improved but we gave up after like 3 hours of recording and used the best take.

They needed a video edited for it, so they reached out to Media. Our advisor recorded the footage of their interviews and they had some footage of their project that they recorded themselves. They came into the studio at the end of the school day and we were there until around 11 getting everything edited and we had a finished project by the end of the night. There were some small issues that I had to fix, but overall it was fine. (they also waited until two days before it was due). I do not think it won, but I could be wrong. Their project was an automatic/manual plant waterer on a wall and it wasn't very good, so they really didn't deserve to win, but I think the video turned out well.
